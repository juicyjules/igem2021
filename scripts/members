Cyanobacteria, because about three billion years ago, they caused the big oxygenation event by releasing O2 as a toxic residue. This caused the death of almost all organisms and simultaneously paved the way for the evolution of new living creatures.

I think that fungi are impressive and scary. <i>Ophiocordyceps unilateralis</i> migrates into the brains of certain insects and forces them through behavioral manipulation to find a convenient place to die. The fungus eats the insides and, after some time, breaks through the head of his host to sporulate.

My favorite organism is the green sea turtle (<i>Onychomys torridus</i>). But still, I admire the age of Jonathan the Seychelles giant tortoise, which is lastly estimated 187 years old and therefore the oldest currently living reptile.
