Vaccinations.

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.120
Medication.

Research.

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:16.060
For all of those things, you need proteins suitable for the usage in the human body. But there is a problem.

5
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.000
In medicine and research, a huge amount of protein is needed every year.

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.200
Until now, those  are mainly produced in common lab organisms like E. coli which are easy to handle, but have one downside:

7
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:33.090
Some proteins need sugars attached to them to reach their full functionality. This process is called glycosylation.

8
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.170
The glycosylation patterns differ between organisms.

9
00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:43.140
If any, E. coli uses patterns very different from human cells, so you canâ€™t use it to produce proteins suitable for humans.

10
00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:51.180
Other organisms that could be used are often difficult to work with, quite expensive or not easy to cultivate.

11
00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.200
Additionally, animal cells bring a lot of ethical issues.

12
00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:01.210
Our team has a solution for all of those problems: Leishmania.

13
00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:06.150
Leishmania are protozoa and mostly known for causing the disease leishmaniosis.

14
00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.140
Our strain, Leishmania tarentolae, is not human-pathogenic.

15
00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:17.090
Leishmania are easy to handle, but their most important advantage is their human-like glycolysation pattern.

16
00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:24.140
We want to establish a system which enables easy and efficient production of proteins in leishmania.

17
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:33.060
To achieve this, we use modular cloning, a system which makes it possible to assemble gene parts in the specific order we want them to, using just one step.

18
00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:44.120
The library we are building for modular cloning in leishmania can be used in science and medicine all around the world to produce proteins in an easy and more affordable way.

19
00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:51.010
Our vision is to make healthcare more manageable and affordable in every part of our world, so everyone can get the care they need.

20
00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:55.170
We are iGem Kaiserslautern 2021 - and this is the way.
