            <p>A very important age group we want to reach are the young people who in a few years will be able to
                make a difference. To contribute to this change we wanted to talk to them about their views on
                genetic engineering. What better place to do that than at the schools where we graduated from. Each
                team member contacted their school and asked for an opportunity to come by and discuss genetic
                engineering. In addition to the trip to our hometowns, we wanted to reach out to students in our
                surrounding area, so we also visited a local school.</p>

            <p>Our goal was to spread awareness and to motivate them to think about some ethical issues on
                controversial topics. First, we gave a short presentation on general genetics to give a brief
                introduction so that the students could participate in the following discussion.
            </p>
            <p>We expected that we would have to initiate the discussion since they had never really been exposed to
                these types of questions. But to our surprise, the students didn't need any help at all to start the
                conversation, in some cases we were even forced to end the discussion due to time pressure.
            </p>
            <p>The students even surprised us with different views on a lot of questions. We are used to talk about
                those things in our group, but we all have a more scientific view around this topic, so it was
                refreshing and very interesting to hear the student’s opinion.
            </p>
            <p>In the following we want to introduce a few questions that we asked the students to better understand
                what our discussion consisted of.
            </p>
            <br />
            <div class="card bg-light mb-3">
                <div class="card-header text-dark">Should Crispr-Cas be allowed for the creation of "designer babies"?
                </div>
                <div class="card-body">
                    <p class="card-text text-dark">
                        We had defined “designer babies” to mean altering physical traits in the forefront. Here we have
                        heard almost solely negative answer. Most of the children where against altering the physical
                        aspects of babies to please the parents, of fear that the individualism and diversity would fade
                        away. On the other hand, we also discussed that science is far away from pinpointing the origin
                        of
                        personality and even with equalizing the whole popularities external appearance, won’t be able
                        to
                        kill individualism. Another interesting contribution of a student was that if he would
                        manipulate
                        the DNA of his child, he couldn’t consider it as his biological child anymore.

                    <p class="card-text text-dark"> The first question seemed easy compared to this one. There was a
                        visible indecisiveness among the
                        students. The difficulty to draw the line between what is considered a disease and what not was
                        also
                        present. One student pointed out that if this would exclusively become accessible for wealthy
                        people, not only will the gap between rich and poor widen, but there is a possibility that those
                        who
                        couldn’t afford this, will be considered and treated as people with disabilities are treated

                    <p class="card-text text-dark">The term de-extinctions can be interpreted in two different ways. The
                        first one is probably what
                        comes instinctively to mind and brings flashbacks of the Film Jurassic Park, trying to get
                        dinosaurs
                        back to life. Most students were against it because of more relevant science to found and also
                        not
                        seeing a real advantage neither for the new animal brought to life to probably end up in a zoo,
                        nor
                        for us humans who would probably end up making a weapon out of it. Another way to understand
                        this
                        question is in view of the development of climate change and with it the environmental changes.
                        The
                        native species are faced in front of changes they don’t have the time to adapt to. One
                        possibility
                        is to relocate those species, in environments better suited for them. One student commented,
                        that we
                        shouldn’t even begin to consider this, because this method would be abused by humans as an
                        excuse to
                        continue with exploiting the resources of the earth.

            <p>All in all we had lots of fun but also learned a lot from these discussions with the students, and
                hope to have left a trace of some kind.

            <p>After a short introduction on who we were and how the evening will take place, we created 4 different
                breakout rooms, in which every participant could choose to go: </p>
            <div class="interesting-box my-3 py-4 px-3">
            <ol class="m-0">
                <li>Sugars of the future – the biotechnological production of healthy sugar substitutes

            </div>

            <h4>Sugars of the future</h4>
            <p>The biotechnological production of healthy sugar substitutes</p>
            <p>In the first room Marcel, a master student from the University of Bonn, held a presentation with the
                title “sugars of the future”. Everyone knows the most common sugar substitutes which by now are
                integrated into our everyday life, but Marcel talked to us about the innovation in this field and about
                new sugar substitute that in near future will probably replace the now known sugar substitutes.</p>

            <h4>Ethical issues in Biotechnology & Animal experiments</h4>
            <p>In this room we tried to engage a conversation about controversial topics. We wanted to get more
                insight on how other students that through iGEM already had the chance to think about genetically
                modified organisms think about certain issues. To get an idea on how the discussion went, we will
                present a few of them.</p>

            <p>Is it acceptable to make a genetically modified pig, that would produce medicine in its milk? (it
                would not have to die) - Is it acceptable to make a genetically modified pig to grow organs for
                humans?
            </p>
            <p>The point where everyone agreed was that if we would begin with something like that, we have to
                ensure the way the animals are kept is not cruel like currently in most cases.
            </p>
            <p>The group that agreed did with the background that today animals are already being used for food
                purposes, and using animals for medical reasons is ethically more acceptable than using them as a
                food source that in most regions is not necessary.
            </p>
            <p>The ones against it said that by using animals for our medical purposes, we would put the human life
                above another animal, and we are not in the position to do something like that.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>What are the ethical issues of prenatal diagnosis?
            </p>
            <p>A few people pointed out that the majority of parents could abort a child with a genetic disfunction
                that isn’t life threatening but rather difficult to integrate in the mainstream society. But one
                took the example of deaf people, and said that if you ask them, a lot, if not the majority would
                tell you that for them wouldn’t change it. They say it could be seen as another form of culture,
                because they have their own language and live through the same difficulties. The society not
                adjusting is a problem but not their lost ability to hear!
            </p>
            <p>A lot of the differences and the diversity in this community would disappear.
            </p>
            <p>With that comes the question where do you draw the line?
            </p>


            <h4>Collaboration
            </h4>
            <p>opportunities, ideas and discussion on how to deal with the COVID-19 regulations</p>
            <p>At first we talked about the situations of the iGEM teams that were present. Who is allowed in the
                lab,
                how many people are in the team, what are their projects. After that we changed our ideas on how to
                optimize the situation, where a few new ideas inspired the teams.</p>

            <h4>Sponsoring tips and tricks</h4>
            <p>In this room we had the help of former iGEM TU_Kaiserslautern Team from 2019 participants who already
                went through all the difficulties and who brought their knowledge to this room. Because we had iGEM
                teams who reached out to us to ask how we are dealing with sponsoring, we wanted to take extra time
                to
                explain every step. They explained the general procedure in detail and let room to answer questions.
                The
                most severe problem was met with too many rejections from a lot of companies. Our tip was to show up
                even more professional, to create a sponsor brochure with all the details, and a list of all the
                offered
                conditions. It could also be more beneficial to call companies, rather to write them an email,
                because
                they can easily be read over and its always more interesting to have a conversation rather than
                reading
                a long text!</p>

            <h2 class="text-heading color-flip" id="head-3">SCIENCE SLAM</h2>
            <p>To bring science from every field closer to our community in an entertaining way, we organized in
                collaboration with iGEM Bonn an online Science Slam. We not only wanted to moderate a talk where
                different scientists present their current work, but rather in an more enjoyable setting. We were
                even
                lucky enough to get an unexpected rap from one of the participants! We were able to gather people
                from
                our university, friends and family but also different iGEM teams. In the middle of the event there
                were
                around 150 viewers who followed the event. We used Twitch to get in touch with the viewers, so that
                they
                can ask questions, and give feedback in the comment section. We also collected donations for the
                winner
                of the science slam, which was elected at the end!</p>
            <p>We were only able to run such an event thanks to the following performers:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Anastasia August</li>
                <li>Matthias Mader</li>
                <li>Sven Krumke</li>

            <h2 class="text-heading color-flip" id="head-4">KINDERUNI</h2>

            <p>
                We had the opportunity to hold a talk at the University event for children. During our talk __
                children
                were present. The children where between __ and __ so we explained the basics of genetics, and
                genetic
                modifications. Our goal was to introduce them a little bit to what DNA is, and what it means to
                change
                it. The event being online didn’t hold the children back to ask some questions. They were really
                invested and asked important questions that we gladly clarified. To share this experience, we’ll
                post a
                few of their good questions:
            </p>
            <li>Does water have dna?
            </li>
            <li>Are there people without DNA?
            </li>
            <li>Do animals have the same DNA as humans?
            </li>
            <li>Do all bananas have the same DNA?
            </li>
            <li>Can you also isolate DNA from dead people?
            </li>
            <li>Can you also isolate DNA from dinos?
            </li>
            <li>Can DNA from animals also be inserted into humans so that they have wings?
            </li>
            <li>Do smaller animals have fewer chromosomes than larger ones?
            </li>
            <li>What happens when a chromosome is missing?
            </li>
            <li>How much DNA do you have from your grandparents?</li>

                <h2 class="text-heading color-flip" id="head-5">ESCAPE ROOM</h2>

                <p>With the help of iGEM teams, we organized a playful way to learn more about the competition, our
                    projects and us. One game that fitted best to our expectations is an interactive escape room on
                    google forms with different riddles, from each team! The iGEM teams from Aachen, Bonn and
                    Dusseldorf
                    helped creating every room, and with that invented different puzzles
                </p>
                <p>Our part includes a hidden word that you can guess through finding the right glycosylation
                    pattern of
                    a protein, a crossword puzzle about our project and the competition, and to visualize what is
                    happening in an eppi whilst our MoClo reaction, a riddle where you have to puzzle successive
                    parts
                    from our vector in the correct order with help of matching overhangs that we also use for our
                    parts
                    list!
                </p>
