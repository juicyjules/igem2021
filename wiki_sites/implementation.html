    <p>For a good research project, it is important to make it available to the general public and for others to benefit from it. Especially in times of a pandemic, like Covid, it is important to synthesize proteins effectively. They are needed for vaccines
        but also for medicines. Leishmania can be used to produce human-like proteins, which is important for the production of many drugs. Our system is particularly valuable for the production of vaccines, as vaccines based on finished proteins offer
        more comprehensive vaccine protection than mRNA vaccines. With mRNA vaccines, the body only receives the blueprint for the respective protein and it is individual how much protein is produced from this mRNA in the end. Thus, the vaccine protection
        is slightly different for each person. With our system, the proteins of the vaccines, which are otherwise only administered as an mRNA sequence, can be produced easily and quickly on a large scale.</p>
    <p>Over the last year, we have discussed our project with a number of external researchers. Some of them work with Leishmania and have difficulties with protein expression and cloning.</p>
    <p>Our MoClo system provides a simple tool that researchers can use to reduce their problems in dealing with Leishmania. We are therefore creating a library of basic parts for the MoClo system in Leishmania. This library can be shared with other teams
        and scientists. It can also be expanded as new parts are added. So, with some time, a large database of genetic parts can be created to effectively produce, detect and purify many different proteins in Leishmania.</p>
    <p>If laboratories are interested in our system, we would provide our domesticated vector and our basic tags as a kit so they can work directly with the MoClo system and only have to design their protein of interest according to the MoClo standards.
        </p>
    <p>When dealing with Leishmania, it is important to always work in sterile conditions and to safely dispose of discard liquid cultures. It is best to autoclave such cultures. Also with the used antibiotics one should always work under the sterile bench.</p>
    <p>In addition, an incubator is required, as the Leishmania must always be incubated at 27°C. The temperature of the incubator must be maintained at this temperature. At temperatures long above 27°C the expression capacity and growth decreases and since
        Leishmania are very temperature sensitive they die..</p>
    <p>However, more research is needed to replicate our system in other laboratories. Our part library needs to grow and some steps need to be optimized. For example, we need to think a bit more about the purification of our expressed proteins in the future,
        as this has often been challenging for us.</p>
