            <p>In Covid-restricted time none of us knew how the whole thing would go. No one knew if we would have the possibility to even get to know any of the other teams. So as Bonn sent us an email asking for help with sponsoring, we took the opportunity and asked them if they wanted to meet and talk about it and maybe about some collaborations. To our luck, they did, and we scheduled our first Meeting in March. Apart from brainstorming collaboration ideas (read more about this: Collaborations) we got to know each other, gave the other team an overview about our projects and talked about our current struggles with iGEM. Since we had some good ideas for Collaborations, we decided to meet regularly to get everything organized. Those meetings always included a lot of general talk about iGEM and everything that was currently going on. On our common discord server, we could always ask the other team everything we needed to know, mostly about competition related things like deliverables or guidelines or something. When it came to the Promotion Video, we helped each other out when we had problems with uploading the subtitles, and one of the members of Bonn also translated our Subtitle into Spanish. Apart from just talking to each other about “work” we wanted to get to know each other better and organized a little online team building event where we played games like Gartic Phone or Scribbl.Io together and had a very fun evening together.</p>
            <p>Meeting online is definitely not the same as in person, but we, TU_Kaiserslautern, were always very glad to have a partner to refer to if we have any problems and really loved to help Team Bonn out here and there. Our special thanks goes to iGEM Bonn for working with us and sharing great times with each other in times of Covid.</p>
