            <p>2021 has been the third year in which the TU Kaiserslautern provided an iGEM team so far. Our team, consisting of ten students of different semesters and fields of study, is united by the love for what we do. We all put so much time and effort into our project and learned a lot on our way, not only about working in the lab, planning and implementing our own projects, but about science communication, the world of science itself and how the everyday life of a young researcher might look like. We learned that putting a lot of effort into something does not necessarily mean to succeed, and that this is totally fine. Even though it has sometimes been difficult to communicate with each other, we grew together as a team and learned a lot about interpersonal relations and, last but definitely not least, ourselves.</p>
            <p>On our way, we were also helped by many people who were essential for the success of our project.</p>
