            <p>Nowadays, proteins are needed for a wide range of applications, for example in industry, pharmacy and medicine to produce food, cleaning agents and drugs like insulin. For a long time, those proteins were obtained from animals, but by now, many proteins can be synthesized in the laboratory using microorganisms, which guarantees a better and more efficient production.</p>
            <p>Especially the field of biotechnology is utilizing the production of proteins in microorganisms. While the technical development proceeds, more and more organisms are genetically engineered to express the desired proteins. There are many conventional organisms for this implementation, including <i>Escherichia coli</i>, <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> and some insect and yeast cells.</p>
            <p>But, especially when it comes to the production of therapeutic proteins, those organisms do have some downsides. For example, their glycosylation patterns - so the way they process proteins through attaching mainly carbohydrates to them -  differ from human glycosylation patterns, which makes it hard to produce properly processed proteins.</p>
            <p>This is where our project comes into play.</p>
            <p>We aim to establish an efficient system for protein production in a microorganism which shows similar glycosylation patterns to humans. - <i>Leishmania tarentolae</i>.</p>
            <p>The inspiration for this project came from our professors Dr. Michael Schroda and Dr. Marcel Deponte. Prof. Dr. Michael Schroda works in his department, among other things, with the Modular Cloning System and Prof. Dr. Marcel Deponte works in his department with the Leishmania. Since the production of proteins is becoming increasingly important in industry and medicine, we decided together in joint brainstorming sessions that we wanted to establish the MoClo system in Leishmania. As a target we have chosen the expression of the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.</p>
            <p>The modular cloning system is a kind of building block system. It enables the simple assembly of various DNA building blocks into a fully functional gene. This can then be introduced either individually or in combination with other genes into the organism of choice where it is to serve its purpose.</p>
            <p>The method of modular cloning is based on the Golden Gate Assembly developed by Marillonet et al. in 2008.<a href="#ref-1" class="source-anchor" id="source-1">[1]</a> This method uses certain enzymes, so-called type II S restriction enzymes, which cut DNA at very specific locations. The special feature of the type II S version of the enzymes, however, is that they do not cut exactly at the recognition sequence specific to them, but at a precisely defined distance from it. The cut then results in four base pairs overhangs on one of the two DNA strands called "sticky ends".</p>
            <p>This ability is exploited in modular cloning in two important ways. Once the desired module (e.g. a promotor), which will later be part of the gene, has been designed, it is treated with the restriction enzyme. Because the cleavage site is not the same as the recognition sequence of the enzyme, the recognition sequence itself can simply be truncated if used skillfully, so that it is no longer present in the finished product.</p>
            <p>In short, once inserted in the right place, the module cannot be removed by the same enzyme.</p>
            <p>The advantage of this process: trimming of the designed module and incorporation into the target vector can proceed simultaneously in one reaction vessel, and the reaction is massively "pushed" in the direction of the desired product.</p>
            <p>The second point making modular cloning truly modular is the ability of the enzyme to always cut at the same distance from its recognition sequence. If you know the distance at which the cut is made and the length of the overhang that is created, you can practically choose the bases that are to be present in the overhang.</p>
            <p>But what is the point of all this? If you choose the overhangs cleverly and match them to each other, you ensure that the modules are always assembled in the correct order.</p>
            <p>The advantage of the whole thing: If you establish this system for a certain organism, you define standardized transitions between the modules. Once you have completed your catalog of module building blocks, you have the option of selecting individual elements from each module group, which then always assemble in the correct order due to the standardized transitions.</p>
            <p>Once created, the basic DNA building blocks, also called genetic parts, can be used again at any time for new constructs and combined with newly created building blocks. In this way, a collection of different parts available for protein expression in the target organism  is created over time.</p>
            <p>As said before, our preferred organism is <i>Leishmania tarentolae</i> which belongs to protozoa. As obligate parasites, Leishmania are dependent on their host and normally undergo a host change during their life cycle. Usually, they first infect a mosquito, whose saliva allows them to invade secondary hosts like sheep, reptiles or humans.</p>
            <p>Once the leishmania have reached their final host, they multiply inside certain blood cells, sometimes causing significant damage to the host. 
            <p>The infectious disease caused by Leishmania is called leishmaniasis, it occurs frequently in tropical regions. But the Leishmania strain we are working with in the lab, <i>Leishmania tarentolae</i>, is non-pathogenic to humans.</p>
            <p>The cultivation of Leishmania is quite simple, as they can be kept in large numbers in liquid medium, similar to bacteria. However, the great advantage of Leishmania, which makes them so valuable for biotechnology, is that the posttranslational modifications of Leishmania are similar to those of humans.</p>
            <p>Therefore, human-like glycosylated proteins can be reproduced with high accuracy in the unicellular organisms. In addition, it is possible to produce particularly large and long proteins in Leishmania, which often fails in other lab organisms due to the sheer size of the molecules.</p>
            <p>In our project we focus on expressing the receptor binding domain of the SARS CoV 2 in Leishmania using the MoClo system.</p>
