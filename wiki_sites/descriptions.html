            <p>Nowadays, proteins are needed for a wide range of applications, e.g. in industry, pharmaceuticals and medicine for the production of food, cleaning agents and drugs such as insulin. For a long time, these proteins were obtained from animals, but now many proteins can be synthesized in the laboratory using microorganisms, which guarantees safer, more technical and more economical production. </p>
            <p>Biotechnology, in particular, is taking advantage of the production of proteins in microorganisms. As technological development advances, more and more organisms are being genetically engineered to express the desired proteins. There are many conventional organisms for this conversion, including Escherichia coli, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, and some insect and yeast cells.</p>
            <p>But especially when it comes to therapeutic protein production, these organisms also have some disadvantages. For example, their glycosylation patterns - the way they process proteins, mainly by attaching carbohydrates to them - differ from human glycosylation patterns, making it difficult to produce properly processed proteins.
</p>
<p> This is where our project comes into play.</p>
            <p>Our goal is to establish an efficient system for protein production in a microorganism that has similar glycosylation patterns to humans. - <i>Leishmania tarentolae</i>.</p>
            <p>The inspiration for this project came from our professors Dr. Michael Schroda and Dr. Marcel Deponte. Prof. Dr. Michael Schroda works in his department with the Modular Cloning System, among other things, and Prof. Dr. Marcel Deponte works in his department with Leishmania. Since the production of proteins is becoming increasingly important in industry and medicine, we decided together in joint brainstorming sessions that we wanted to establish the MoClo system in Leishmania. As a target we have chosen the expression of the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.</p>
            <div class="d-flex">
        
            <p>The modular cloning system is a kind of building block system. It enables the simple assembly of various DNA building blocks into a fully functional gene. This can then be introduced either individually or in combination with other genes into the organism of choice where it is to serve its purpose.</p>
<div class="text-center"><img class="right-bound" id="source-2" src="https://2021.igem.org/wiki/images/d/d9/T--TU_Kaiserslautern--MoClo.png" class="img-fluid" alt="..."></div>
       
        </div>
        <p>The method of modular cloning is based on the Golden Gate assembly developed in 2008 b y Marillonet et al. <a href="#ref-1" class="source-anchor" id="source-1">[1]</a> This method uses certain enzymes, so-called type II S restriction enzymes, which cut DNA at very specific locations.  However, the peculiarity of the type II S version of the enzymes is that they do not cut exactly at the recognition sequence specific to them, but at a precisely defined distance from it. The cut then results in four base pairs of overhangs on one of the two DNA strands, known as "sticky ends."</p>

        <div class="d-flex">
<div class="text-center"><img class="right-bound" id="source-4" src="https://2021.igem.org/wiki/images/b/b0/T--TU_Kaiserslautern--Restriktionsenzyme.png" class="img-fluid" alt="..."></div>

            <p>This ability is exploited in modular cloning in two important ways. Once the desired module (e.g., a promoter) that will later be part of the gene is designed, it is treated with the restriction enzyme. Since the cleavage site is not identical to the recognition sequence of the enzyme, the recognition sequence itself, if used skillfully, can simply be truncated so that it is no longer present in the finished product.</p>
            </div>
            <p>In short, once the module is inserted in the right place, it cannot be removed by the same enzyme.</p>
            <p>The advantage of this process is that trimming of the designed module and insertion into the target vector can be done simultaneously in one reaction vessel, and the reaction is massively "pushed" toward the desired product.</p>
            <p>The second point that makes modular cloning truly modular is the ability of the enzyme to always cut at the same distance from its recognition sequence. If you know the distance at which the cut is made and the length of the resulting overhang, you can virtually choose the bases that should be present in the overhang.</p>
            <p>The advantage of all this: When you set up this system for a particular organism, you define standardized transitions between modules. Once you have completed your catalog of module building blocks, you have the ability to select individual elements from each group of modules, which will then always assemble in the correct order based on the standardized transitions.
</p>
            <p>The advantage of the whole thing: If you establish this system for a certain organism, you define standardized transitions between the modules. Once you have completed your catalog of module building blocks, you have the option of selecting individual elements from each module group, which then always assemble in the correct order due to the standardized transitions.</p>
            <p>Once created, the basic DNA building blocks, also called genetic parts, can be reused at any time for new constructs and combined with newly created building blocks. In this way, a collection of different parts is created that are available for protein expression in the target organism is created over time.</p>

            <p>As said before, our preferred organism is <i>Leishmania tarentolae</i> which belongs to protozoa. As obligate parasites, Leishmania are dependent on their host and normally undergo a host change during their life cycle. Usually, they first infect a mosquito, whose saliva allows them to invade secondary hosts like sheep, reptiles or humans.</p>
<div class="text-center"><img id="source-2" class="right-bound" src="https://2021.igem.org/wiki/images/4/42/T--TU_Kaiserslautern--Leishmanien.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="..."></div>
</div>
<p>Once the leishmania have reached their final host, they multiply inside certain blood cells, sometimes causing significant damage to the host. 
<p>The infectious disease caused by Leishmania is called leishmaniasis, it occurs frequently in tropical regions. But the Leishmania strain we are working with in the lab, <i>Leishmania tarentolae</i>, is non-pathogenic to humans.</p>
<p>The cultivation of Leishmania is quite simple, as they can be kept in large numbers in liquid medium, similar to bacteria.</p>
<p>Therefore, human-like glycosylated proteins can be produced with high accuracy in the unicellular organisms. In addition, it is possible to produce particularly large and long proteins in Leishmania, which often fails in other lab organisms due to the sheer size of the molecules.</p>
<p>In our project we focus on expressing the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 in Leishmania using the MoClo system.This is important for research, among other things, because various experiments can be carried out with the RBD, which can provide a better understanding of the infection process of the Coronavirus. Furthermore it may be possible to produce a protein-based vaccine.
