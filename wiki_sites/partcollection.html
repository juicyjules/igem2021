    <h2 id="head-1" class="text-heading color-flip">FLUORESCENT TAGS</h2>

    <h3>mVenus</h3>
    <p><b>size</b> 26.9 kDa</p>
    <p><b>excitation wavelength</b> 515 nm</p>
    <p><b>emission wavelength</b> 537 nm</p>
    <p>available in cloning positions <b>B3_B4</b>, <b>B4</b> and <b>B5</b></p>
    <p>The protein with the poetic name mVenus is a <b>yellow fluorescent protein</b> and a derivation of the famous
        green fluorescent protein GFP, originally isolated from the <b>bioluminescent jellyfish</b> <i>Aequorea
            victoria</i> in <b>1962</b>. Even though the purpose of this extraordinary sea creature‘s bioluminescence is
        still unknown, its fluorescent proteins are of immense importance to modern biological research. This is not
        surprising, considering the great practicability of fluorescent reporter systems. By coupling a protein of
        interest with a <b>fluorescent tag</b> such as mVenus, the target protein can be easily and non-invasively
        detected within living cells as well as cell preparations with the help of fluorescence spectroscopy and
        microscopy.</p>

    <h3>mCerulean B3_B4, B4, B5</h3>
    <p><b>size</b> 26.8 kDa</p>
    <p><b>excitation wavelength</b> 435 nm</p>
    <p><b>emission wavelength</b> 477 nm</p>
    <p>available in cloning positions <b>B3_B4</b>, <b>B4</b> and <b>B5</b></p>
    <p>Much like mVenus, the <b>cyan fluorescent protein</b> mCerulean is derived from the green fluorescent protein GFP
        originally isolated from the <b>bioluminescent jellyfish</b> <i>Aequorea victoria</i> in <b>1962</b>. Like its
        molecular siblings, it can be cloned to a gene of interest and thus provide fast and non-invasive screening
        opportunities for the resulting fusion protein, for example via fluorescence spectroscopy or microscopy.</p>


    <h2 id="head-2" class="text-heading color-flip">PURIFICATION TAGS</h2>

    <h3>8His</h3>
    <p><b>size</b> (+ PreScission™ motif) 2.3 kDa</p>
    <p>available in cloning position <b>B3</b>
        <p>The 8His-tag is a so-called <b>polyhistidine-tag</b>, meaning that it is a small amino acid chain consisting
            of, in this case, eight consecutive <b>histidine residues</b>. The histidine sidechain contains a
            heterocyclic <b>imidazole</b> ring which is negatively charged in neutral to basic conditions and can
            <b>coordinate with metal ions</b> with very high affinity. Thus, equipping a target protein with a terminal
            histidine rich peptide sequence allows for purification of the protein via <b>immobilized metal ion affinity
                chromatography</b>. Here, <b>divalent nickel</b> or <b>cobalt</b> ions are attached to a carrier
            material and bound by the polyhistidine-tag upon addition of the cell lysate. Meanwhile, non-tagged proteins
            only display weak metal ion affinity and can be discarded in the flow through. Later on, the bound target
            protein can be easily eluted from the carrier material with the help of <b>pH titration</b> or high excess
            <b>molecular imidazole</b> which competes with the His tag for metal ion coordination. Since His tags are
            small in size and rely solely on the protein’s primary structure, they are the preferred choice for protein
            purification under <b>denaturing conditions</b>.</p>
        <div class="important-warning">
            <h4>Important</h4>
<p>
            In order to utilize this basic part for creating L1 constructs, your protein of interest <b><u>may
                    not</u></b> contain any <b>PreScission™ Protease</b> recognition sites (LEVLFQ ▼GP). Please verify
            via sequence analysis or PCR and remove any intrinsic recognition motifs, i.e. by introduction of silent
            single point mutations.
    </p>
</div>
<h3>Strep-tag II</h3>
<p>available in cloning positions <b>B3</b> and <b>B5</b></p>
<p>When it comes to biomolecular detection and purification set-ups, the Strep-tag system is an absolute laboratory
    staple. In its principle it relies on the high affinity binding of the homo-tetrameric protein <b>streptavidin</b>,
    first isolated from the bacterium <i>Streptomyces avidinii</i>, to the vitamin <b>biotin</b>. The binding of these
    two biomolecules is one of the strongest non-covalent interactions observed in nature and inspired the creation of
    many derivatives with even further enhanced binding capabilities. The German biotech company <b>IBA Life
        Sciences</b> developed a synthetic eight amino acid peptide called <b>Strep-tag II</b> which binds to the
    specifically engineered streptavidin derivative <b>Strep-Tactin</b> with high specificity. Thus, fusing a gene of
    interest to a Strep-tag II allows for efficient purification of the target protein by <b>affinity chromatography</b>
    over immobilized Strep-Tactin. The bound target protein can later be eluted with <b>desthiobiotin</b>. Due to its
    small size and biochemical inertia, the addition of a Strep-tag usually doesn’t influence correct target protein
    folding and functionality. Furthermore, the purification procedure can be executed under physiological conditions,
    making the Strep-tag system particularly suitable for purification of native, <b>functional proteins</b>.</p>
<h4>For B3</h4>
<p><b>size</b> (+PreScission™ motif) 2.3 kDa</p>
<div class="important-warning">
    <h4>Important</h4>
   <p> In order to utilize the Strep-tag II in B3 for creating L1 constructs, your protein of interest <b><u>may
            not</u></b> contain any <b>PreScission™ Protease</b> recognition sites (LEVLFQ ▼GP). Please verify via
    sequence analysis or PCR and remove any intrinsic recognition motifs, i.e. by introduction of silent single point
    mutations.</p>
</div>
<h4>For B5</h4>
<p><b>size</b> (+8His fusion) 2.3 kDa</p>
<p>In <b>cloning position B5</b> of our cloning kit the Strep-tag II motif was fused to eight histidine residues,
    rendering the <b>Strep8His-tag</b>. This allows for purification of the target protein employing either of the two
    molecular systems and makes our expression system more practicable, since fewer constructs are needed to suit
    different experimental environments or laboratory repertoire.</p>

<h3>GST</h3>
<p><b>size</b> 25.5 kDa</p>
<p>available in cloning positions <b>B3</b> and <b>B5</b></p>
<p>The GST-tag has been around since the late 1980s and, unlike most other purification tags, does not only consist of a
    small peptide, but rather an <b>entire functional protein</b>. GST is short for <b>glutathione S-transferase</b>, a
    highly abundant <b>cytosolic enzyme</b> that is usually involved in protecting prokaryotic as well as eukaryotic
    cells from <b>extracellular toxins</b>. It does this with the help of the redox peptide <b>glutathione</b>, to whose
    reduced form it binds with very high affinity. By fusing a gene of interest with a GST-tag, the resulting fusion
    protein can be purified from cell preparations with the help of <b>affinity chromatography</b>, employing reduced
    glutathione (GSH) as the respective column material. Due to the highly specific binding, only GST-tagged target
    protein should remain bound to the column and can afterwards be eluted by adding <b>high excess molecular GSH</b>.
    Since the affinity binding relies on the structural integrity of the GST protein, GST-tag purification can only be
    performed under <b>native, non-denaturing conditions</b>.</p>
<p>One more thing - while small peptides such as polyhistidine or Strep-tag usually do not interfere with protein
    functionality, the <b>sheer size of the GST-tag</b> may sometimes even overshadow that of the target protein or
    hinder its enzymatic activity. Therefore it might be necessary to <b>cleave off</b> the GST-tag for more in-depth
    analysis of your purified target protein. In order to enable easy cleavage of the GST-tag, we included a
    <b>TEV-protease recognition site</b> into our tag. You can find out more on this protease-mediated cleavage in the
    paragraphs below.</p>
<h4>For B3</h4>
<p><b>size</b> (+PreScission™ motif) 26.3 kDa</p>

<h2 id="head-3" class="text-heading color-flip">DETECTION TAGS</h2>

<h3>3xHA</h3>
<p><b>size</b> 3.56 kDa</p>
<p>available in cloning positions <b>B2</b> and <b>B5</b></p>
<p>The <b>HA epitope tag</b> was first established in <b>1988</b> by J. Field and his colleagues, making it one of the
    oldest protein tags still in use. Its characteristic amino acid sequence YPYDVPDYA is based on a small segment of
    the viral protein <b>hemagglutinin</b> (abbreviated as <i>HA</i>), one of three integral membrane proteins in the
    <b>Influenza A virus</b>. The epitope segment was chosen due to its high immunogenicity and antibody affinity which
    is further increased by fusing multiple epitope copies in a row (<b>three copies</b> = 3xHA). A vast variety of
    monoclonal <b>primary antibodies</b> from different species have been established against the HA epitope,
    eliminating the need for expensive protein-specific antibodies and facilitating target protein <b>detection</b> and
    <b>purification</b>.</p>

<h3>Myc</h3>
<p><b>size</b> (+PreScission™ motif) 2.5 kDa</p>
<p>available in cloning position <b>B3</b></p>
<p>The Myc-tag, along with 3xHA and 3xFLAG-tag, is yet another <b>epitope tag</b> designed for protein purification and
    detection with the help of specific antibodies. It consists of a small peptide whose amino acid sequence
    (EQKLISEEDL) was originally derived from the transcription factor <b>MYC</b>, which is encoded by the human
    protooncogene <i>c-myc</i> and plays an important role in the regulation of endogenous gene expression. A
    pathological, constitutive expression of c-myc may lead to an increased gene expression of genes involved in cell
    cycle regulation and cell proliferation, thus facilitating the formation of cancer. The gene’s and with it the tag’s
    name stems from the cancerous disease <b>myelocytomatosis</b> which is observed in birds and is caused by a
    virus-induced misregulation of c-myc gene expression. When it comes to experimental uses, the Myc-tag can be used
    for all detection and purification purposes that involve binding of the target protein to antibodies, such as
    immunoprecipitation or affinity chromatography, and eliminates the need for protein-specific antibodies. It is
    advised best to not use a Myc-tag in combination with a secretion signal peptide such as our sAP1-tag, since it may
    interfere with the correct translocation of the target protein into the secretory pathway.</p>
<div class="important-warning">
    <h4>Important</h4>
    <p>In order to utilize the Strep-tag II in B3 for creating L1 constructs, your protein of interest <b><u>may
            not</u></b> contain any <b>PreScission™ Protease</b> recognition sites (LEVLFQ ▼GP). Please verify via
    sequence analysis or PCR and remove any intrinsic recognition motifs, i.e. by introduction of silent single point
    mutations.</p>
</div>
<h3>3xFLAG®</h3>
<p><b>size</b> (+PreScission™ motif) 4.2 kDa</p>
<p>available in cloning position <b>B3</b></p>
<p>Much like the 3xHA tag, the 3xFLAG®-tag is a small polypeptide epitope tag. Yet, unlike the 3xHA-tag, its amino acid
    sequence is not derived from a naturally occurring protein, but was instead artificially designed to be an epitope
    for specifically developed primary antibodies. It was first described in <b>1988</b> by Hopp et al. as a single Flag
    tag consisting of the eight amino acid sequence DYKDDDDK. The high content of polyvalently anionic amino acids (like
    aspartic acid and tyrosine) makes it less likely to interfere with target protein activity. Over the years, many
    variations of the original Flag-tag were established, including the very commonly used <b>3xFLAG®-tag</b> patented
    by <b>SigmaAldrich</b> with the slightly modified sequence DYKDHDG-DYKDHDI-DYKDDDDK. It contains multiple epitope
    copies, hereby further increasing the tag’s affinity to the anti-Flag antibodies. The 3xFLAG®-tag can be used for
    all detection and purification purposes that involve binding of the target protein to antibodies, such as
    immunoprecipitation or affinity chromatography, and eliminates the need for protein-specific antibodies.</p>

</div>
<h2 id="head-4" class="text-heading color-flip">SECRETION TAG</h2>

<h3>sAP</h3>
<p><b>size</b> 2.3 kDa</p>
<p>available in cloning position <b>B2</b></p>
<p>The sAP tag is a <b>secretion signal peptide</b> derived from the secretory protein <b>secreted acid phosphatase 1
        (sAP1)</b> which was originally purified from <i>Leishmania mexicana</i>, a human pathogenic Leishmania strain.
    The secretion of acid phosphatases makes the parasites more resistant to oxidative stress induced by the host’s
    immune cells. The secretion signal peptide found in sAP1 mediates the exocytosis of the protein after its
    biosynthesis in the endoplasmatic reticulum (ER). This is extremely useful for recombinant protein production, since
    target proteins can be harvested directly from cell culture supernatant without the need for cell lysis. Since
    <b>posttranslational glycosylation</b> of proteins happens within ER and Golgi apparatus along the <b>secretory
        pathway</b>, the sAP1 signal peptide tag furthermore enables the <b>production of glycosylated proteins</b> in
    Leishmania. This makes the sAP1 tag a vital part of our cloning kit, since employing Leishmania as an alternative
    expression host for biopharmaceuticals relies on correct reconstruction of the proteins‘ glycosylation patterns.</p>

<h2 id="head-5" class="text-heading color-flip">PROTEASES</h2>

<h3>TEV Protease</h3>
<p><b>recognition motif</b> *NLYFQ ▼S, * = E,G,A,M,C,H</p>
<p>The TEV protease is a cysteine protease domain originally derived from the <b>tobacco etch virus (TEV)</b>, a plant
    virus that infects a wide variety of nightshades and weeds, including the eponymous tobacco plant. The protease is
    known for its extremely <b>high sequence specificity</b>, meaning that it only cleaves proteins upon recognition of
    a fixed set of amino acid sequences, with little to <b>no off-target effects</b>. This makes it a valuable tool in
    modern biotechnological research, since it allows for precise protein cleavage at easily predefined positions. By
    including a <b>TEV recognition motif</b> on either side of a tag sequence, the respective tag can be cleaved off
    after protein purification via the addition of TEV protease to the mix. Many commercially available TEV proteases
    are furthermore <b>fused to an affinity tag</b> themselves, making the retrieval of cleaved target protein even more
    feasible and minimizing the risk of uncoordinated proteolytic activity due to overexposure. The only requirement for
    a target protein to be fused with a TEV tag and purified using TEV protease is that the protein sequence ought to be
    <b>free of any intrinsic TEV recognition sequences</b>. This should be ensured beforehand, via sequence analysis or
    PCR, and any observed recognition sequences should be removed, i.e. by the introduction of silent single point
    mutations.</p>

<h3>PreScission™ Protease</h3>
<p><b>recognition motif</b> LEVLFQ ▼GP</p>
<p>The PreScission™ Protease is a commercial variant of the <b>human rhinovirus 3C protease (HRV 3C)</b>, a <b>cysteine
        protease</b> that usually helps rhinoviruses to infect human cells by disrupting the cells‘ endogenous
    transcription activity. By including a <b>PreScission™ recognition motif</b> on either side of a tag sequence, the
    respective tag can be cleaved off after protein purification via the addition of the protease to the mix. Most
    commercially available HRV 3C proteases are furthermore <b>fused to an affinity tag</b> themselves in order to
    facilitate the retrieval of cleaved target protein. In the case of the PreScission™ Protease, this affinity tag is a
    <b>GST tag</b>. This is very advantageous especially when it comes to GST-tagged target proteins, because they can
    be purified by affinity chromatography and directly eluted with PreScission Protease. The cleaved off target protein
    will enter the eluate while the protease itself will adhere to the GSH column matrix, eliminating the need for
    protease removal in a later stage. The only requirement for a target protein to be fused with a PreScission™ tag and
    purified using PreScission™ protease is that the protein sequence ought to be <b>free of any intrinsic PreScission™
        recognition sequences</b>. This should be ensured beforehand, via sequence analysis or PCR, and any observed
    recognition sequences should be removed, i.e. by the introduction of silent single point mutations.</p>

<h2 id="head-6" class="text-heading color-flip">OUR PROTEIN OF INTEREST</h2>

<h3>SARS-CoV2 spike protein RBD</h3>
<p><b>size</b> 25.1 kDa</p>
<p>available in cloning positions <b>B3_B4</b>, <b>B3</b> and <b>B4</b></p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has been sweeping the world for almost two years now, costing millions of lives and causing
    immense economical, cultural and social damage. The virus responsible for the outbreak of the eponymous respiratory
    disease was named <b>severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2</b> or short <b>SARS-CoV-2</b>. Much like other
    coronaviruses, its infectiousness relies on multimeric protein structures that project outwards from the virus
    envelope’s outer surface. Due to their appearance, these protein complexes are often called <b>spikes</b>. They
    consist of a trimeric complex of the so called <b>spike protein</b> and coordinate the recognition, binding and
    entry of the virus into the host’s cells. The spike protein itself is a <b>glycoprotein</b> consisting of two
    separate regions, S1 and S2, of which S1 contains the <b>receptor binding domain (RBD)</b> and mediates cell
    binding, while S2 contains a <b>fusion peptide</b> and initiates the actual endocytosis of the virus particle. As
    the entry point into host cells, Sars-CoV-2 makes use of the <b>angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)</b>, a
    transmembrane protein mainly present in intestinal, kidney and cardiac cells and involved in blood pressure
    regulation. The highly specific binding of the Sars-CoV-2 receptor binding domain to ACE2 is significantly dependent
    on the <b>posttranslational glycosylations</b> that the RBD undergoes. This makes the recombinant production of
    correctly glycosylated spike protein very valuable for infectiological research and vaccine development. Thus, by
    including the Sars-CoV-2 RBD into our cloning kit, we not only demonstrate the significance of our expression system
    to the advancement in current coronavirus research, we also reveal the glycosylation capabilities of our expression
    host <i>Leishmania tarentolae</i>.</p>
